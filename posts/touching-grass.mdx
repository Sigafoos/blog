Fighting the empty page syndrome.

I'm [Dan](https://danconley.net): Eagle Scout, former Cubmaster of Pack 539, current Webelos Den Leader in the pack, and Assistant Scoutmaster of [Troop 539](https://539bsa.com). I'm good at knots and bad at plant identification.

There are a few recent events I'd like to post about, so I wanted to finally get the site set up.
